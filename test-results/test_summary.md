## ‚ùå Issues Found

### Critical Model Field Mismatches

1. **Category Model Issues** - All category tests failing
   - Issue: Test expects `description` field but model may not have it
   
2. **ProductBarcode Model** - Unexpected keyword arguments
   - Issue: Test uses `barcode_type` field but model doesn't have it
   - Needs field alignment between model and tests

3. **InventoryItem Model** - Multiple method failures
   - Issues with quantity validation, consume method, add_stock method
   - Date validation problems
   - Property method failures (is_expired, is_low_stock, days_until_expiration)

4. **StorageLocation Model** 
   - String representation mismatch
   - Invalid choice for `location_type` field ('refrigerator' not valid)
   - Temperature validation issues

## üîß Required Fixes

### High Priority
1. **Align model fields with test expectations**
   - Review and update model field definitions
   - Ensure choice values match test data
   - Fix field type mismatches

2. **Method Implementation**
   - Implement missing model methods (consume, add_stock)
   - Fix property calculations (is_expired, days_until_expiration)
   - Add proper validation logic

3. **Field Validation**
   - Review and fix choice field options
   - Implement proper date validation
   - Add quantity validation logic

### Medium Priority
1. **Test Data Alignment**
   - Update test data to match model constraints
   - Fix choice field values
   - Align string representations

## üìä Database & Infrastructure Status

‚úÖ **Django Configuration:** Working  
‚úÖ **Database Migrations:** Applied successfully  
‚úÖ **Test Discovery:** Working  
‚úÖ **Basic Model Creation:** Working for some models  

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Fix Model Definitions**
   - Review each failing model against its tests
   - Add missing fields and methods
   - Update choice field options

2. **Update Tests**
   - Align test data with actual model constraints
   - Fix any outdated test expectations

3. **Re-run Tests**
   - Systematically test each model after fixes
   - Ensure all model tests pass before moving to integration tests
